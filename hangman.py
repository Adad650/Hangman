# Choose a word bewtween 2 - 8 letters long.

#Hi

# Create a list of letters by taking each letter from the word and putting it in the list one by one. Name this list actualWord

# create a list that is the same length as the word but filled with underscores. Name this list secretWord

# Initialize all required variables
# A int varaible with 6 in it to keep track of the number of lives. "Lives = 6"


# The user puts it there first guess. Check the length of the users guess to ensure that it is 1 letter

# Make a for loop to compare the letter that the user guessed to each letter in the list
## Within the for loop, do the following:
## Run the for loop for the length of the list
## Compare the character that the user guessed to each items in the list actualWord. 
## Cycle through the actualWord list using the iteration variable in the for loop
## if the character that the user typed is the same as the character in the actualWord at that location, If the userInput == actualWord[i], Then secretWord[i] = userInput
## Compare secretWord to actualWord
## When they are the same Break from the for loop  
## Break when the user runs out of guesses (i.e. when Lives = 0)
## If user is incorrect Lives -= 1
## Print secretWord again and lives left


#If the user fails to guess the word, computerPermissionToBullyUser = True
