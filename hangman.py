# Choose a word bewtween 2 - 8 letters long.
## In a for loop until a good word is found (i.e. the word is 2-8 characters long)
## Request a word from https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word 
## if word length is between 2-8, then store the word in variable: word
## else continue back to the for loop

# Convert the word in the variable word to a list named actualWord

#Hi


# create a list that is the same length as the word but filled with underscores. Name this list secretWord

# Initialize all required variables
# A int varaible with 6 in it to keep track of the number of lives. "Lives = 6"


# The user puts it there first guess. Check the length of the users guess to ensure that it is 1 letter

# Make a for loop to compare the letter that the user guessed to each letter in the list
## Within the for loop, do the following:
## Run the for loop for the length of the list
## Compare the character that the user guessed to each items in the list actualWord. 
## Cycle through the actualWord list using the iteration variable in the for loop
## if the character that the user typed is the same as the character in the actualWord at that location, If the userInput == actualWord[i], Then secretWord[i] = userInput
## Compare secretWord to actualWord
## When they are the same Break from the for loop  
## Break when the user runs out of guesses (i.e. when Lives = 0)
## If user is incorrect Lives -= 1
## Print secretWord again and lives left


#If the user fails to guess the word, computerPermissionToBullyUser = True
